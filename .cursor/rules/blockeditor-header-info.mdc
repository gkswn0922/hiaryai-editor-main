# BlockEditor Subcomponents Rule

The [EditorHeader.vue](mdc:src/components/BlockEditor/components/EditorHeader.vue) and [EditorInfo.vue](mdc:src/components/BlockEditor/components/EditorInfo.vue) components follow shadcn-vue conventions:

- Each is a single file component (SFC) in the `src/components/BlockEditor/components` directory.
- Used as subcomponents for the BlockEditor, providing header and info UI.
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and utility classes.

For subcomponent best practices, see the [shadcn-vue Card documentation](mdc:https:/www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/card) as a reference for splitting UI into logical parts.
