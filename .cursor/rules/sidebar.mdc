# Sidebar Component Rule

The [Sidebar.vue](mdc:src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.vue) component follows shadcn-vue conventions:

- It is a single file component (SFC) in the `src/components/Sidebar` directory.
- Used for navigation or contextual side panels.
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and utility classes.

For sidebar best practices, see the [shadcn-vue Sidebar documentation](mdc:https:/www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/sidebar) as a reference.
