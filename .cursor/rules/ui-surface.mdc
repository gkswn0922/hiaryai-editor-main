# Surface Component Rule

The [Surface.vue](mdc:src/components/ui/Surface.vue) component follows shadcn-vue conventions:

- Single File Component (SFC) in `src/components/ui`.
- Used for providing a consistent background, border, and shadow for content containers.
- Accepts `withShadow`, `withBorder`, and `class` props (all optional, default: true for shadow and border).
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and utility classes.
- Used as a base for other container components like Panel.

For container best practices, see the [shadcn-vue Card documentation](mdc:https:/www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/card) as a reference.
