# PanelHeadline Component Rule

The [PanelHeadline.vue](mdc:src/components/ui/Panel/PanelHeadline.vue) component follows shadcn-vue conventions:

- Single File Component (SFC) in `src/components/ui/Panel`.
- Used for displaying a styled headline or title within a panel.
- Accepts `asChild` and `class` props.
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and utility classes.
- Uses `Primitive` from radix-vue for polymorphic rendering.

For header best practices, see the [shadcn-vue Card documentation](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/card) as a reference.
