# Colorpicker Components Rule

The [ColorButton.vue](mdc:src/components/panels/Colorpicker/ColorButton.vue) and [ColorPicker.vue](mdc:src/components/panels/Colorpicker/ColorPicker.vue) components follow shadcn-vue conventions:

- Each is a single file component (SFC) in the `src/components/panels/Colorpicker` directory.
- Used for color selection UI in panels.
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and utility classes.

For color picker best practices, see the [shadcn-vue Input documentation](mdc:https:/www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/input) as a reference for input components.
